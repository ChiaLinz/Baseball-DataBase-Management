## Introduction:

Enterprise Database Management is an essential course for anyone interested in understanding the complexities of managing large databases. Under the guidance of <b>Professor James Markulic</b>, we explored a baseball-related database that covered a wide range of topics, from basic to advanced. The course consisted of nine different topics, including creating tables, SQL queries, creating functions, triggers, and more, along with an extra project.

Throughout the course, we were required to load the baseball database and work on various SQL queries and functions using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. To help others practice using this tool, I have organized all the questions in separate folders with my answers. The repository is a great resource for anyone interested in learning and improving their SQL manipulation skills.

In summary, this project not only taught me the ins and outs of managing a database but also allowed me to hone my SQL skills. I hope that this resource will be helpful to others in their quest to master the intricacies of enterprise database management.

## 00. Load the Baseball Dataset | [Tutorial](https://github.com/ChiaLinz/Baseball-DataBse-Management-System/blob/0e56956278276fc47135353923534c3b6b35b0aa/00.%20Install/00.%20Creating%20the%20Baseball%20Database%20Using%20Scripts.pdf)

The first step in this project is to load the baseball dataset. This dataset contains information about various baseball players and teams, including their statistics, demographics, and other relevant information. Loading this dataset is a crucial step in analyzing and manipulating the data using SQL queries and functions.

To load the dataset, we will be using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, which is a powerful tool for managing databases. This tool provides a user-friendly interface for loading and manipulating large datasets, making it ideal for this project.

Once the dataset is loaded, we can start exploring the data and working on various SQL queries and functions to extract meaningful insights. This step is critical for anyone interested in enterprise database management as it lays the foundation for further analysis and manipulation of large datasets.
